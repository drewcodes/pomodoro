# pomodoro clock

This project is built around the "pomodoro clock" concept that helps increases productivity by intelligently managing time working and taking breaks. The idea that a user can be productive for 25 minutes and break for 5 minutes relieves the user from being fatigued and wanting to stray from their tasks.

-The clock loads a 25 minute timer by default. A 5 minute break timer is also set.

-Easy to navigate buttons allows users to increment or decrement the timers by 5 minutes at a time. The shortest of both clocks being 5 minutes, with no maximum time limit.

-The clock will exhibit a pop-up alert when either timer has completed. A reset button is then presented to the user to restart the timers.
